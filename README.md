# MLCreditClassification
As our code is all in a .ipynb file, it can be run one cell at a time in Jupyter Notebook by simply selecting a cell, then clicking the apparent “Run” and “Run Selected Cell” button. It is important to mention that some of these cells, particularly the last one that generates our model’s accuracy scores, can take a while to fully complete. Additionally, be sure to import all the required libraries such as sklearn, xboost, and matplotlib before running the code, and be sure to change any directories so that some of the bigger visuals will be saved somewhere that suits your machine. The same goes for loading the dataset in the first cell of the ipynb file. Make sure to change the directory of the "train.csv" dataset to one that matches the file's location on your computer for the pd.read_csv() function to be able to properly locate the file and read it.
